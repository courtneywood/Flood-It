# Flood-It
Created a version of the game Flood It, where the player plays simultaneously with a computer. The first player to fill their board with the same color is the winner.

INSTRUCTIONS:
The object of Flood It is to ‘flood’ the screen with the same color of squares. 
You do so by starting at the top left square. 
From there, you select a square with the color you want, and your ‘flood’ area will grow to include that color (as long as the color is adjacent to your starting square). 
You keep selecting colors and your ‘flood’ area grows until the whole screen is one color.
Every time you make a move, the computer will also make a move on their board.
Your goal is to flood your whole board before the computer floods their board! Good luck!
